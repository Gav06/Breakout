## Breakout
Just a simple clone of the Atari Breakout game. Written in a day using Kotlin, LWJGL, and JOML. Rendering is done with modern OpenGL. Maybe I'll add sounds and more features, but maybe I won't. Download fat jar with dependencies from releases.
### Building
Just clone rep and run 
`./gradlew build` for Unix-like systems or Windows Powershell

`gradlew.bat build` for Windows command prompt

It is probably easiest to open and run using IntelliJ IDEA
